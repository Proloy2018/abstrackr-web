<h1>GDPR Notification: AbstrackR</h1>
<h2>Data Collection Disclosure</h2>
<p>
In order to provide service, we collect basic information to identify and to keep your data separate from other users. Basic information we collect include your name, email address, password, a username and an estimate of how many systematic reviews you have participated in. All of this information is provided to us by you and we do not share it with any third parties in any shape or form.
</p>

<h2>Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
<p>
In order to provide you with basic functionality of abstrackR we need to keep your data separate from other users. We accomplish this by associating the data you enter into abstrackR and the work you do with your user account. A username is chosen for convenience and to increase the security of your data. While you may freely share your email with all kinds of services every day, you probably rarely share specific usernames with others. We therefore highly recommend that you choose a username specific for the use of abstrackR when signing up with our service. The password you choose is also necessary for the security of your account information as it provides an extra layer of protection. Again, please choose a password that is different from any other password that you use elsewhere. While there is often much debate about the complexity of passwords, we believe that it isnâ€™t the complexity but the length of the password that is important. Therefore, please select a password that is as long as possible (or convenient) for your use. Your password is stored in our database in its hashed form, which means that even in the case that someone gains access to our database they would not be able to reverse it back to the plain text form from the hash due to the asymmetric nature of hashing. Nevertheless, it is important once again that you use different passwords for different services and so once again we ask that you choose a password that is unique to the use of abstrackR when you create an account. We do our best to keep all of your information safe but no online service can guarantee absolute security and so we take every precaution we can to protect your data and your rights and we ask the same of you.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention Period</h2>
<p>
We do not have a limit on how long we retain your account information and/or data.
</p>

<h2>Right to Access</h2>
<p>
You have the right to access any and all information we have about you in our records. If you wish to attain a copy of all information on file for your account, please contact us at the email below.
</p>
<h2>Right to Erasure</h2>
<p>
If it is important to you that we remove your personal information from our records, please contact us at the email below.
</p>
<h2>Disclosure of Data Sharing with 3<sup>rd</sup> Parties</h2>
<p>
We do not share any information with third parties.
